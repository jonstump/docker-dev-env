This is a docker setup for my personal dev environment. This is to make jumping between systems easier and to have my own personal environment setup fairly quickly day one of a new computer.

This is currently a work in progress. I will update this readme with proper instructions when I've been able to fully implement it without bugs.

Technologies used:
Docker
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - I prefer LTS versions for development environments, but this could easily be changed
bash
zsh - With MacOS now shipping with zsh I like using it as my standard unix shell
neovim

Other Included bits:
This includes my most commonly used dotfiles and shell scripts for setting various things up.

* I came across this repo in my results and liked that it was a fairly simple setup that I could use as a template to input my own options and tools for my need. If you came across this repo, check this one out as well.
